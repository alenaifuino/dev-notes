# Python Notes

### Logging
It can be used in two broad ways:
* **Basic interface**: simpler. Useful for scripts and some mid-size applications
* **Logger Objects**: More complex to set up. Far more powerful. Scales to any size

#### Basic Interface
```python
import logging
logging.warning('Cuidado!')
```
